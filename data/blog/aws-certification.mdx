# What is a Certified Cloud Practitioner?

This is the introduction to AWS certifications, the bottom of the ladder. This is not to say this doesn't mean it carries good weight. For me, this was a fun experience to see what I knew already from a couple years in the cloud and in datacenters already cross paths with concepts that I either had a passing familiarity with or were brand new to me. AWS really has a product for everything, and that's hardly hyperbole. This certification means that I am certified to work in the cloud. This is not required, but it does demonstrate that, from AWS' perspective, you are knowledgeable about the Cloud.

# How Did You Get Your Certification?

## Studying. Lots of studying.

This included open source knowledge on YouTube, github, and free public resources from AWS or those who have passed the exam already. It encompassed about 4 - 6 hours every week of lecture videos and practice exams over the course of a few weeks. This is not going to be the experience of everyone looking to get their certification, however, as I came in with lots of on-prem knowledge and a couple years in the cloud already. This is not a one-size-fits-all approach, but this was my experience with studying.

I was lucky enough to get a course from A Cloud Guru for free which I think was the biggest factor. I am a lecture learner, and having a speaker explain to me what the concepts were allowed me to take what I had learned and make decisions and come up with solutions based on that.

## Just Sign Up For It

No, seriously! There is never a worse time than now to at least shoot for the moon. It's a couple hours of testing, either in person at a certified testing center or online. I took the in person, as it was much less hassle to make sure my venue was secure. I hear anecdotes of those taking the exam having to move cameras around rooms, cover up desks, throw blankets over monitors, and much worse, and that just didn't appeal to me.

# What's Next?

The next exam, of course. Next in my sights is the Solutions Architect Associate exam. It's a bit more difficult, I've had to do significantly more studying, but I'm very hopeful. And hey, if it helps with my yearly salary, what's the harm
